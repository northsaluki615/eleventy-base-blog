## üó°Ô∏è The Master Sword

**Finding the Lost Woods:**
- The Master Sword is located in the Lost Woods, within the Hyrule Great Forest north of Hyrule Castle.
- Approach from the Woodland Tower; the forest is surrounded by water.
- To enter the Lost Woods, follow the path northeast of the tower until you reach a foggy area and a large ruined arch.

**Navigating the Lost Woods:**

- Stay on the path. Deviating results in being sent back to the last checkpoint.
- Use the torches as guides. Follow the direction the embers blow in the wind.
- If lost, heading southwest between two trees towards a valley in the middle of the forest helps you find the entrance to the Korok Forest.

**Obtaining the Master Sword:**

- The Master Sword is in the center of the Korok Forest.
- To pull it, you need 13 Heart Containers. You can get Heart Containers by exchanging 4 Spirit Orbs or completing Divine Beast Dungeons.
- Without enough Heart Containers, attempting to pull the sword drains your health.

**Wielding the Master Sword:**

- The Master Sword can be used anywhere but attacking regular enemies will wear it down, and it needs time to regenerate.
- It doesn't wear down when fighting Ganon or infected Guardians, doubling its damage from 30 to 60 in their presence.

**Next Steps:**

- After obtaining the Master Sword, the next main quest is "Destroy Ganon."
