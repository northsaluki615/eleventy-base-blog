## Mike Helmers

{% image "./mike-helmers-profile.jpg", "Mike, in a favorite shirt." %}

Living in Madison, WI with my son, my partner, and my dog. I like to write about my experiences, my thoughts, and my feelings. I'm a fan of the [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/), and I'm working on making my site more interactive and more connected.

### Professional Journey

My career in cybersecurity began with a deep fascination for technology and security. Over the years, I have honed my skills in identifying vulnerabilities, implementing robust security measures, and ensuring compliance with industry standards.

### Academic Pursuits

I am pursuing a graduate degree in Cybersecurity, where I delve into advanced topics such as threat analysis, network security, and cyber defense strategies. My academic journey complements my professional experience, equipping me with cutting-edge knowledge and practical skills to tackle emerging cyber threats.

### Personal Interests

When I'm not immersed in the world of cybersecurity, you can find me exploring the realms of fantasy as a dedicated Dungeons & Dragons enthusiast. This hobby not only fuels my creativity but also enhances my problem-solving abilities and teamwork skills.

### Projects and Initiatives

I am actively involved in several projects that align with my professional and personal interests:

- **Smart Home Automation:** Building a connected and secure smart home using Home Assistant and Amazon's Alexa.
- **Web Development:** Creating and maintaining a personal website with custom CSS themes, including Latte, Macchiato, Frappe, Mocha, Forest, and Druid.
- **Cybersecurity Research:** Conducting in-depth analyses of security and compliance for Microsoft 365 Government G3 vs. G5 licenses.
